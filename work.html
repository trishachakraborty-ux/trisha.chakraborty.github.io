									<h2>Project Overview</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p> Vela is a weather forecast app developed during my UX design course at CareerFoundry. It required me to create a web app with a mobile-first approach that can provide beautifully displayed and easy to understand weather reports, forecasts, and statistics for sailors, surfers, divers, and any other water sports. <br/>
								This app provides detailed weather forecasts from a different aspect of climates such as wind speed, wind knots, wind gusts, rain accumulation, thunder, waves, cloud coverage, and many more. There too many water sports out there already, such as Surfing, Sailing, Jet skiing, Kitesurfing, Canoeing, and many other activities that depend on the weather forecast.
                                </p>

									<h2>The Challenge</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p> 
								 Weather Forecasting is important as it helps to determine future climate expectations. There are already numerous weather apps out in the market to provide weather forecasts in general (Temperature, Rain, Snow, Fog). However, there is less amount of app which can provide general weather forecasts as well as give updates for various watersports together. Based on my surveys and interviews, I have found that people are using multiple apps to check weather forecasts in general and a separate one for their watersports. I wanted to create an application that can create a solution for both problems. <br/>
                                 Aimed to bridge the gap between weather forecast in general and weather forecast for various watersports, Vela can provide daily (Temperature, Rain, Snow, Fog) and detailed watersports related weather updates.
								 </p>

									<h2>The Process</h2>
								</header>
								
								<header class="major">
									<h3>The Problem Statement</h3>
								</header>
								
								<p> Our users of the Vela app need a way to find their location, check the weather (e.g. Temperature, Wind with speed and direction, rain and thunder, precipitation type, Clouds, Waves, Weather warnings) and connect with the locals, because they want to be prepared for a variety of water sports beforehand and they are interested to know more about local water sports. <br/>
                                I will know this to be true when I see our users are easily finding their location in the app to check out the weather forecast for varieties of water sports anywhere around the world. </p>
								
								<header class="major">
									<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
								</header>
								
								<p>I have used multiple Weather applications, but none to use for water sports. Hence this research stage was very interesting and intriguing for me. At first, I needed to find out what's out there to have a better understanding of the industry and what people's thought about them. To accomplish this, I choose two strong applications, Windy and Windfinder. I conducted a competitive analysis on them to have a better understanding of their key features. <br/>
                                This allowed me to see the current trends and gain valuable insight into how they are providing accurate weather forecasts for different types of water sports.
                                </p>
								
								<header class="major">
									<h3>User Flows</h3>
								</header>
								
								<p>
								I created user flows based on the user Personas and their significant user stories. I included every interaction a user would take to complete an action by using an app function. I choose two personas to create the user flows, Adrian and Ameli. It documents how Adrian would save a Surfing Spot and how Ameli would check the weather forecast for the upcoming 10 days.

									<h3>Wireframes</h3>
								</header>
								
								<p>
								With the information I gathered from the Define phase, I started building Low and Mid fidelity wireframes. Low-Fidelity wireframes were made by using pen, and paper, the mid-fidelity wireframes were made in Balsamiq ad the high fidelity were made in Adobe XD. 
								</p>
								
								<header class="major">
									<h4>Low Fidelity</h4>

								<header class="major">
									<h4>Mid Fidelity</h4>
								</header>
								
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Vela/Wireframes_Mid fidelity.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								
								<header class="major">
									<h4>High Fidelity</h4>
								</header>
								
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Vela/Wireframes_High_Fidelity.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								
								<header class="major">
									<h3>Typography & Colors</h3>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Vela/Colors.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								
								<header class="major">
									<h3>Prototype</h3>
								</header>
								
								<p>
                                After finalizing the wireframes, I created a prototype for Android using <strong> Adobe XD </strong> and gathered users' feedback.								
								</p>
								
								<ul class="actions special">
									<li>
									   <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/9b24e023-0510-45a0-7e45-82026c66038c-ed15/" target="_blank"  class="button large">Android Prototype</a>
									</li>
								</ul>
								
								<header class="major">
									<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
								</header>
								
								<ul>
								  <li>There is plenty of areas where Vela needs improvements. The design area of the overall app is the most important one as of now, which should look more polished and clean so that it can be more smart and intuitive.</li> 
								  
								  <li>I need to conduct more user testing mostly on the functionality of this app. I have also planned to do several A/B testing, and surveys concentrating entirely on my UI.</li>  
                                  
								  <li>I also need to add a few more screens on the app to make it overall complete. It will help me to achieve more users, who can have a clear understanding of the overall idea behind the app, and also the purpose of it.</li> 
								</ul>
